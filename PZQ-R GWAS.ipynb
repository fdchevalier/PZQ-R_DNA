    "## Aim\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the different analyses regarding the mapping of the quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated to praziquantel (PZQ) resistance. We performed a genome-wide association study on a population of *Schistosoma mansoni* (SmLE-PZQ-R) which is polymorphic for PZQ resistance ([Couto *et al.*](https://doi.org/10.1590/s0074-02762011000200006)). The population was treated with a dose of 24 Âµg/mL of PZQ and survival of the worms was objectively assessed using a lactate assay. Pools of the 20% lowest and 20% higher lactacte producer were made. The GWAS was conducted with two independent biological replicates and each library was sequenced in triplicate for assessing allele frequencies. We compared allele frequencies between pools in order to identify the genomic locus involved in PZQ resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "After identifying the QTL related to resistance, we performed a marker assisted selection to create two populations: an enriched population in PZQ resistance allele (SmLE-PZQ-ER) and an enriched population in PZQ sensitive allele (SmLE-PZQ-ES). We confirmed the phenotype by assessing PZQ response using a lactate assay and confirmed that the desired locus was the only one differentiating the two populations.\n",

The percent reduction observed was significantly different between the SmLE-PZQ-ES and SmLE-PZQ-ER parasites (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.0129).

We saw no impact of PZQ-treatment for either female or male worms in mice infected with SmLE-PZQ-ER. These results show that in vivo PZQ response in treated mice differs between SmLE-PZQ-ES and SmLE-PZQ-ER parasites.
